Connect a display and keyboard (and mouse if preferred) to the server. Power on the server and wait until the boot menu on the top of the screen is displayed - at this point press F10 (Life Cycle Manager) on the keyboard and... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>OpenStack Deployment - Overview</title><link href="/posts/openstack-deployment-overview/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="OpenStack Deployment - Overview" /><published>2021-01-30T07:00:00-07:00</published> <updated>2021-01-30T07:00:00-07:00</updated> <id>/posts/openstack-deployment-overview/</id> <content src="/posts/openstack-deployment-overview/" /> <author> <name>Mateo Ortegon</name> </author> <category term="Training-SOC" /> <category term="OpenStack" /> <summary> The purpose of this guide is to aid in the replication and maintenance of our OpenStack cloud by documenting the deployment process. Versions The software versions used in the BSU environment are as follows: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal) for the MAAS server, Juju client, Juju controller, and all cloud nodes (including containers) MAAS 2.9.2 Juju 2.7.6 OpenStack Wallaby Hardware Layout (5... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>OpenStack Deployment - Network</title><link href="/posts/openstack-deployment-network/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="OpenStack Deployment - Network" /><published>2021-01-28T07:00:00-07:00</published> <updated>2021-01-28T07:00:00-07:00</updated> <id>/posts/openstack-deployment-network/</id> <content src="/posts/openstack-deployment-network/" /> <author> <name>Mateo Ortegon</name> </author> <category term="Training-SOC" /> <category term="OpenStack" /> <summary> Architecture Serving DHCP We have the option to let our router or MAAS serve DHCP, and both options have their implications. Letting MAAS Serve DHCP When MAAS is serving DHCP, MAAS will automatically discover a server that is PXE booting on the same network. When a server is booting over PXE, MAAS takes over by providing a boot image and automatically listing the node under “Machines” on the... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>OpenStack Deployment - MAAS</title><link href="/posts/openstack-deployment-maas/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="OpenStack Deployment - MAAS" /><published>2021-01-27T07:00:00-07:00</published> <updated>2021-01-27T07:00:00-07:00</updated> <id>/posts/openstack-deployment-maas/</id> <content src="/posts/openstack-deployment-maas/" /> <author> <name>Mateo Ortegon</name> </author> <category term="Training-SOC" /> <category term="OpenStack" /> <summary> Controller OS One server that isn’t part of the OpenStack cluster (but is on the same network) needs to be the designated “MAAS Controller”. The MAAS Controller will “manage” the hardware (servers), meaning it can power on/off + deploy operating system images to each of the servers networked in the OpenStack cluster. Installing the Operating System Though most Debian Linux distributions would w... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>OpenStack Deployment - JuJu</title><link href="/posts/openstack-deployment-juju/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="OpenStack Deployment - JuJu" /><published>2021-01-26T07:00:00-07:00</published> <updated>2021-01-26T07:00:00-07:00</updated> <id>/posts/openstack-deployment-juju/</id> <content src="/posts/openstack-deployment-juju/" /> <author> <name>Mateo Ortegon</name> </author> <category term="Training-SOC" /> <category term="OpenStack" /> <summary> JuJu will have two parts to it, one is the application we interact with through command-line (which gets installed on the MAAS Controller), and the other is the JuJu Controller itself which actually “orchestrates” the commands we give JuJu through the command line. JuJu will have control of MAAS, so it can power-cycle nodes as needed when we deploy the OpenStack Charm containers later on. Insta... </summary> </entry> </feed>
